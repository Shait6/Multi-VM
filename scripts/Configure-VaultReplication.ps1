Deprecated: this script previously attempted to set backup storage replication for a Recovery Services Vault.
Per repository policy the template no longer configures replication automatically. Replication should be
set manually after vault creation if required (recommended: GRS).

The script is retained only as a placeholder and will not perform any action.

Write-Host "Configure-VaultReplication.ps1 has been deprecated and no longer performs replication changes."
